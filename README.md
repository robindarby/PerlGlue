# PerlGlue III: perl as mobile glue

This repo. contains all the code examples to accompany Robin Darby’s talk on perl as mobile glue.

You should find all the service side code and phone gap templates used for creating the ‘PerlGlue’ iPhone app: http://itunes.apple.com/app/yapc-na-2012-perlglue/id531823487?mt=8

I’ve included a sample vhost configuration in the ‘conf’ directory just to show you how I set the end-points up. The rest of the apache configuration is down to you.
